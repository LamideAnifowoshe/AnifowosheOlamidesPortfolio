desired goals. My hope is to get knowledge and experience in order
to benefit myself on the long term

### [ Project 1: GROUNDWATER POTENTIAL ZONE MAPPING OF LANIBA,AKINYELE LOCAL GOVERNMENT AREA OF IBADAN, OYO STATE USING GEOSPATIAL MULTI-CRITERIA ANALYSIS AND HYDROGEOPHYSICS](https://github.com/AnifowosheLamie/project1/blob/main/ANIFOWOSHE%20OLAMIDE%20ESTHER%E2%80%99s%20Project.pdf)
 

With the increase in population of Akinyele local government area, the necessity to provide water to the populace has become a disturbing problem. In this study, a systematic approach to delineate the groundwater potential zones of the area was carried out using Remote Sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Hydrogeophysics as a tool. Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES) observations were also carried out to validate the results obtained from the integrated remote sensing and GIS observation and also determine the aquifer depth and possible pollution.
